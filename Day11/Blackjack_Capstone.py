"""
Blackjack Game (Console Version)

Description:
-------------
This is a simple, text-based implementation of the classic card game Blackjack (also known as 21).
The game is played between one player and the computer acting as the dealer.

Objective:
-------------
The goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.

How to Play:
-------------
- The player and dealer are each dealt two cards.
- The player can choose to:
    - "Hit" to draw another card.
    - "Stand" to end their turn and let the dealer play.
- The dealer must hit until their hand value is at least 17.
- Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
- Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever is more favorable to the hand.
- If the playerâ€™s hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose automatically.
- After the player stands, the dealer reveals their hand and plays.
- The winner is determined by whoever is closer to 21 without going over.

Enjoy the game!
